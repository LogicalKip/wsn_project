wsn_project
===========

A C++ project made with Qt during an internship.
It's more or less a game where sensors have to be scattered and linked together into a network in order to detect wild fires, therefore earning points, which allow the improving of the sensor network. 
MVC is used, thus the graphical interface could easily be switched to another library.
